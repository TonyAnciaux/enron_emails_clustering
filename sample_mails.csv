Cheap Tickets, Cheap Shares

By Chris Nerney

It's an e-tailer that still derives most of its revenue from non-Internet
sources, which, along with the amusing ads featuring William Shatner,
might explain why it has gotten less publicity (or notoriety) than chief
competitor priceline.com.

But though Cheap Tickets may have no high-profile celebrity pitching its
low air fares and hotel rooms, the Hawaii-based company does have one
thing for which priceline.com and its investors would no doubt pay dearly:
profits.

In fact, CTIX has run in the black for seven straight quarters, the most
recent (Q3) showing net income of $4.3 million, or 18 cents per share, on
revenues of $121.4 million.

In contrast, priceline.com, with much higher revenues of $341 million in
the third quarter, turned in a loss of $199 million, or $1.19 per share.
Last Thursday, the troubled ""name your price"" e-tailer announced yet
another round of layoffs and the cancellation of plans to expand its
services.

And while PCLN has been one of the biggest busts among 'Net stocks this
year - down 95% through Monday's trading, despite surging up 30% after
last week's news - Cheap Tickets shares have declined by only about
one-third since Dec. 31, closing Monday at $8.75.

Which could mean there's more downside coming for CTIX. However, the
company's highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy to
prevent much more stock-price erosion. With a market capitalization of
$218 million, Cheap Tickets is valued at 0.5x trailing 12 months' revenue
of $416.5 million. That's the best revenue-multiple valuation I've ever
seen among profitable Internet companies.

Of course, as mentioned earlier, Cheap Tickets really isn't a pure
Internet play. Begun in 1986, the company's prime business - which
accounts for 94% of sales - is to purchase non-published air fares from
the carriers and re-sell them at a discount to consumers. Up until 1997,
all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retail
outlets.

This changed in 1997, when CTIX launched its cheaptickets.com Web site. By
last year's third quarter, 27% of sales came via the Internet. That
increased to 37.4%, or $45.4 million, in the recent third quarter.

Further, while Internet-based revenues are rising both on a dollar and
percentage basis, call center and retail revenues actually are declining
on a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web, a strategy shift
that has been accompanied by higher gross margins.

All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise. Now
here's why I don't expect them to rise too far.

The main problem is a severe slowdown in revenue growth. Sales in the
recent third quarter were just 10% above last year's Q3, down from Q2's
25% year-over-year revenue increase, which was way below the 65% increase
in first-quarter sales. Granted, the increase in Internet-based revenue
for Q3 was 53% over the year-ago period, but even that number isn't
eye-catching among 'Net investors.

Then there's the threat of competition, including Hotwire.com, a discount
travel Web site start-up that is being supported by a six major airlines.
Other airlines also should be expected to get more directly involved in
selling unsold and unpublished air fares, a trend will put even more
pressure on Cheap Tickets to develop other revenue sources.

With viable options for 'Net investors seemingly shrinking on a daily
basis, Cheap Tickets is definitely worth a look. It is profitable and its
shares affordable, which bodes well should a larger player eventually
scoop up the company.

Solid content providers with a real audience are being

cannot be preserved. Maybe we got it wrong in promoting the

Economists: Relax, This Won't Hurt a Bit

Most of us like recession speculation about as much as we like tetanus
shots. A business forecast from UCLA brought out the big needle on
Monday and predicted a 60 percent chance of the r-word in 2001. Like
your doctor, the UCLA economists said it would only pinch a little,
and then it would all be over.

CBS MarketWatch, Newsbytes and MSNBC provided good summaries of the
report, which insisted everything would be peachy again in 2002.
Newsbytes' Michael Bartlett led with some encouragement for deflated
techie egos: ""The stimulus of the Internet-led 'New Economy' was
enough to keep the current economic expansion in the United States
driving forward for four years longer than it might have,"" he said,
paraphrasing the report. Funny how everyone's putting ""new economy"" in
quotes these days - it used to seem so real.

The San Jose Mercury News called the predicted downturn ""recession
lite"" and noted that local California readers ""will escape the worst
of it."" (A separate UCLA report on California put the odds of a
statewide recession at 40 percent; report author Tom Lieser prefers
the term ""deceleration."") Many experts expect 3 percent growth next
year, so the Merc's Jennifer Bjorhus called other economist to compare
notes. One Bay Area econ professor agreed that we may be in trouble,
but the UCLA report ""has other economists scratching their heads,""
said Bjorhus. ""I don't know of anybody else that's out there that
far,"" said economist Richard Carlson.

We do. CBS MarketWatch columnist Paul Farrell wondered if the slump
has already arrived, citing Ken Kurson's article ""Nine Signs We're
Already in a Recession"" in Esquire's December issue. Kurson's thesis
made sense and ""was worth the price of the magazine,"" but in the end,
Farrell shrugged it off. ""Neither Esquire's Grinch nor the U.S.
Supreme Court is going to steal my Christmas,"" he wrote. If only we
could face the doctor with such self-assurance. - Jen Muehlbauer

Sun Hears It Through the Grapevine

Didja hear the one about Sun's irregular accounting practices? Sun CFO
Michael Lehman did, but by the time he denied it, the stock had
already taken a hit. ""These rumors have no basis in fact and are
false,"" said Lehman in an indignant (and redundant) statement released
on Monday.

The rumor said ""a short-seller had published a compelling report
charging accounting irregularities,"" explained TheStreet.com. Finer
points were scarce, and that's probably just the way Sun spokesperson
Mark Paisley liked it. Since the gossip had no source or details,
""That should tell you about the quality of the rumor,"" he told
Reuters. After Lehman's official denial, Sun shares rebounded a bit in
after-hours trading, showing that some traders who believe rumors also
believe prepared corporate statements.

Accounting scuttlebutt may have been the catalyst for Friday's Sun
selloff, said TheStreet.com, ""But more notable was what the
book-cooking rumor obscured: a survey from small, Chicago research
shop Off The Record Research showing slowing sales of Sun servers to
its distributors."" The Financial Times also noted analyst's worries
about Sun sales, and Wall Street's concerns about Sun's ability to
spar with HP, Compaq and IBM. Suddenly, everyone's in the server biz,
and Sun's not looking so invincible anymore.

Sun did get a bit of good press this week, by helping to form an
industry group to develop online audio and video standards. Then
again, the group ""is sure to create a battle for market control with
(media player companies) RealNetworks Inc. and Microsoft Corp,"" said
the San Jose Mercury News. We'll have to wait and see whether Sun
shares rise or set on this new development. - Jen Muehlbauer

Courts Taming the Wild, Wild Web

This morning's news was peppered with court cases that collectively
reined in profane names, spam and anonymous libel on the Net.

USA Today ran an Associated Press story on a case that time and
competition have rendered moot. Adult Web-site operators had sued
Network Solutions because NSI, at the time the sole registrar of
domain names, refused to issue names the AP characterized as
""www.(pickanyobscenity).com."" (Last year, competing registries began
accepting registrations for such names.) The judge ruled that domain
names are mainly about navigation, not about communicative speech. The
AP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internet
experts on possible reverberations from the case.

The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won by
an individual against an anonymous online poster. The Post's story, by
Brian Krebs of Newsbytes, disentangled the complicated tale more
clearly than did CNET's AP copy. A U.S. District judge awarded
$675,000 to an Emory University professor after an anonymous poster
accused him of taking kickbacks. The poster, unmasked in the
investigation, was a former employee of the company he accused of
making the payoff. The Post provided the critical detail that that
company had fired the libeler. Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz, a policy
analyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology, for the bottom
line: ""There's not much difference between saying slanderous things
online or offline. ... In terms of anonymity, it's probably much
easier to send letters in the mail.""

Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicited
commercial e-mail. The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on a
rather typical spammer who had hijacked a company's computer to spread
millions of spams offering porn and get-rich-quick schemes. What
wasn't typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked down
and arrested. He pleaded guilty to second-degree forgery and faces up
to seven years in prison.

Wired News and InternetNews assigned reporters to the other spam case,
this one involving Web host Verio's use of ""whois"" customer
information from Register.com in violation of the registrar's
acceptable-use policy. The case has not yet gone to trial, but a
federal judge ordered Verio to stop using the whois data to barrage
Register.com's customers by e-mail, phone and mail. Writing for
InternetNews, Clint Boulton detailed the judge's order and talked to
outside experts on the possible effects of the judge's order. Boulton
quoted a Washington lawyer who emphasized the b-to-b aspect of the
tussle: ""What this case does is go further in protecting the
relationships a business has with its customers."" - Keith Dawson

Answers Elusive For Ask Jeeves

By Chris Nerney
Senior Analyst

In May 1999, he predicted the company would be profitable within 24
months.

With only five months to go, it now looks like Ask Jeeves is falling
somewhat short of CEO Robert Wrubel's bold proclamation.

But Wrubel won't be at the helm when next May arrives, for he is stepping
down from the chief executive's post and relinquishing his seat on the
board of directors. Many current Ask Jeeves employees also may find
themselves in other jobs come May, as heavy layoffs loom for the
red-drenched ""natural language"" search portal and technology company.

None of which should be surprising to anyone looking beyond the prodigious
hype that has accompanied the marketing-savvy firm for most of its brief
existence.

Among those ignoring the warning signs for too long were the half-dozen or
so analysts who rushed to downgrade ASKJ shares late last week after the
company warned that fourth-quarter losses, already expected to be bad (33
cents per share), would be even worse (50 cents per share). Some had cut
their ratings for Ask Jeeves earlier in the year (though not enough),
while at least a couple - First Union and US Bancorp Piper Jaffray - each
had rated ASKJ a ""strong buy"" by late July.

I won't have to lower my assessment of Ask Jeeves, because I've always
been skeptical about the company's business model, technology claims and
long-term prospects, even before its July '99 ticker debut.

Since its moonshot IPO, Ask Jeeves has consistently turned in quarterly
reports showing deep operating losses and revenues that failed to justify
the company's previously lofty valuation. Shares reached absurd heights a
year ago (closing at $186 on Nov. 16, 1999) and have been unraveling ever
since. After Thursday's Q4 warning, ASKJ plunged 66% to $3.25 by early
Friday afternoon, a price that leaves the stock with a 97% loss for the
year. Put that in the Macy's Day parade and see if it floats.

The company insists it can make a profit by Q4 2001, or a year from now.
Given the Q4 preview, that's a tall order. First, softness in spending on
online advertising is expected to continue through the first two quarters
next year, and perhaps beyond. In fact, fourth-quarter sales are forecast
to be about $25 million, less than the previous two quarters. So Ask
Jeeves may have trouble increasing revenues, even as it tries to move
further away from dependence on ad dollars and toward business services.

Net loss for Q4 is expected to be $18 million, or 50 cents per share,
which may be worse than street estimates, but still is a big improvement
over Q3's net loss of $39 million, or $1.08 per share. If a company's
revenues are flat and it's losing money, there's only one way to erase the
operating deficit: Cut costs. That might be accomplished in part through
increased efficiencies. However, the traditional and surer method is an
employee blood-letting.

That's what Ask Jeeves will be looking forward to next year - if it's
lucky. If it's not...well, we all know the answer to that one.

It sounds like your having a blast in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit

of the world.  I have some friends that are moving to London in January, so I

that will have to be the first trip I take.

On a different note, this wednesday was a bit like a stick in the eye.  
However, there's 
always next week.

Robin's last name is now Zivic, so her new handle is Rhonda Zivic (Honda

That's it for now.

right...
i did write more, but i don't think it went through.
anyway, just got back from asia.  after thailand, i
went to singapore (bright lights, big city), malaysia
(resort in the south (note: resorts not fun during
monsoon season), and cambodia (worth the visit, esp if
not harassed by customs officer).  all in all, i would
say that the best place i went to was Chiang Mai,
Thailand.  Thailand, as a whole, is the kind of place
that i would visit many times.

hope all is well at big E.  hope weds are treating you

CTS HOT TODAY...By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 2, Number 208 __________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today is to help
you prepare for the trading day ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (12/12)
--------------------------------------------------------

""Develop a Solid Daily Routine"" (A classic from the archives)

Some of the best traders I know are incredibly disciplined
about their daily routine. They believe their routine gives them an
edge and they will not trade with out it. For your benefit, I will
describe the routine that my Father passed along to me.

It all starts with the Benjamin Franklin secret to success;
Early to bed and early to rise.
In bed by 10:00 PM ET and up at 5:00 am ET.
Watch CNBC for 15 to 20 minutes to see what developed
in over night action. Exercise for 30 minutes and then have a
well balanced breakfast.  Arrive at the trading desk by 6:30 am
EST.
Print out all CTS weekly and daily charts and look for our
preferred technical set-ups. Look for well established trends
that were under going intermediate term corrections back to major
support (resistance levels).
After finding the best 2 to 3 trade opportunities for that day,
go to the hourly charts. If inclined to buy, consider waiting
until hourly stochastics are oversold. For new shorts, require
stochastics to be overbought. To refine timing for entry and exit,
look for clear cut Elliott wave patterns or classical price
patterns on the hourly charts. The hourly Elliott wave patterns
are tradable, because you know quickly when you're wrong.

This routine may or may not work for you.  The main point I'm
trying to make, is that every trader needs a routine that he or she
believes in. The routine helps you focus your research and thus
maximize your ability to find winning trades.

N

-------------------------------------------------------
Key Technical Developments (close of 12/11)
-------------------------------------------------------
The December Canadian dollar is retesting the neckline of the large
head and shoulders top as seen on the weekly charts. The pattern
projects a decline to the 62.00 level over the next few months.

The March Yen is pausing above long term support. A decline below
Friday's low near 91.24 opens the door for a massive decline of 700-
1000 points over the next few months.

Nearby hogs got quite a boost from the nasty weather over the
midwest. Blizard conditions will likely take their toll on nearby
supplies.

SPECIAL ELECTION CONFERENCE CALL: On Friday, Nov. 10, Mark Melcher, an
independent political analyst, and I discussed the likely consequences of
the Presidential election mess. You can listen to the rebroadcast at
www.yardeni.com/waf.asp.

DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX. BROWN'S TECH 2000 CONFERENCE: Watch this premier annual
tech conference live from Nov. 13-16. I will speak on the outlook for the
tech industry on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 11:30 am (est). Register now at
www.webevents.broadcast.com/db/techconf1100/frameset.html.

COMMENT: In the latest Congressional elections, the Republicans still held
on to their majorities in the Senate and the House, but barely. Whoever is
the next President has no mandate whatsoever. The voters in their collective
wisdom have given us the most gridlocked political system in our nation's
history. This suggests that the country is evenly and hopelessly split into
two factions with very different agendas. Or else, the country is mostly
satisfied and prefers to veto both the Gore and the Bush agendas. I think
the latter is a more accurate interpretation of the Presidential and
Congressional votes. Obviously, this political stalemate could be a
decidedly bearish outcome, especially if the legitimacy of the new president
is questioned. More likely, the new president and Congress will seek out
common ground for bipartisan legislative initiatives. The stock market may
remain on the defensive until this outcome is clearer. In any event, extreme
policy changes are now almost certainly extremely unlikely. This should
ultimately be bullish for both bonds and stocks.

SUBSCRIBERS: For more of my thoughts on the election, see my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, which also includes my outlook for profits in 2000. The
latest EARNINGS WEEK reviews the significant drop in consensus earnings
expectations.

EXCERPT (Nov. 6 GPS): ""Last week, I had the opportunity to speak at a
conference in Santa Clara, California on the impact of new technologies on
the real estate industry. While I was in Silicon Valley, I also stopped by
the Deutsche Bank office in Menlo Park. It is located on Sand Hill Road, the
West Coast's Wall Street for high-tech startups. The well-manicured road is
lined with the offices of venture capitalists (VCs). I am happy to report
that while the tech wreck in the stock market may have wiped out most
dot-coms, their financiers are alive and well. They are regrouping and
working hard to find and incubate the next New New Thing.

The VC phenomenon is a vital and unique aspect of the New Economy. The New
Economy is driven by a New Paradigm. The New Paradigm is actually a very old
paradigm called Competition. The most important characteristic of a
competitive market is that there are no barriers to entry. One of the
greatest barriers to entry is the availability of financing. The VCs have
virtually eliminated this barrier in the technology industry.

Of course, the Sand Hill Gang went too far over the past year. Money was too
easily available for any startup with a dot-com included in the company's
name. Early in their studies, economists are taught that in competitive
markets, marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The VCs gave away too much
money to too many harebrained entrepreneurs, and the result was probably
close to a zero marginal return averaging the many small losers with the few
really big winners.

The willingness of VCs and their limited partners to take on enormous risk
to finance entrepreneurs with untested ideas and innovations is a great
source of the New Economy's creativity, strength, and productivity. In the
past, entrepreneurs were stymied by the unwillingness of bankers to take a
chance on them. In the 1980s, Michael Milken revolutionized this process by
raising money for entrepreneurs directly in the capital markets. He invented
the concept of issuing high-yield bonds as an alternative to bank financing.
The VCs have taken this concept to the next level. Instead of entrepreneurs
searching for financing, the VCs are searching for entrepreneurs to finance.

Many of the VCs are relatively young, in their 20s and 30s. So are many of
the portfolio managers of the technology mutual funds. Just for fun, I often
ask these folks if they know what VC once meant before venture capitalists.
Most of them are stumped. During the bad old days during the war in Vietnam,
it stood for Viet Cong.

Today's VCs are also well trained in the art of the ambush. They are
constantly on the hunt for new-new companies that can put old new-new
companies out of business. They are today's financiers of the process of
""creative destruction,"" which was brilliantly explained by Joseph
Schumpeter. This means that no business is safe from competition. Indeed,
the most successful and most profitable businesses are the ones that are
most at risk from a deluge of VC money financing wanna-be competitors.

The bottom line is that technology will continue to be the most innovative
and the most
competitive industry, with great rewards and great risk.""

32,RE: Bove,"I've been on the road the last few days trying to find new engineers and am
just now digging through my email stack.

I assume the question concerns the big chunk of metal that has a steel bar
pressed into an aluminum base and a slanted steel plate on top.  Tom Murray
helped me build it.  We are both class of '79 and I believe we built it in
'78 or '79.  We put it together in the old Washburn machine shops were I
was working as an assistant.  The idea of the steel plate was to put the
brothers name once each week when it was passed around.  Dave M. has a much
better recollection of how it was introduced than I do so I will let his
version of the events stand.

For the history of the award and how it all started you will have to ask
someone else.

One of these years I'll get back for a reunion but I've been living in
Switzerland for the last 10 years and with a family it's not so easy to get
over very often.  Noone sings ""Home on the range"" anymore but I do enjoy
the yodelling and Swiss alphorns.  I actually don't feel that far away from
the USA.  I can get TexMex to eat right around the corner from the office.
The night of the election one of the main Swiss television stations had an
all night broadcast  and people are always asking me who is going to win.
I sometimes think the Swiss are talking about the election as much as the
Americans.  The more sensible ones understand what's happening.  In any
case my kids (10 and 12) are very interested and it gives me a chance to
explain how the system works (or doesn't depending on your viewpoint).  By
the way, when is someone going to come over for a visit ?

I'm the Manager for National Instruments here for those of you familiar
with LabVIEW.  Just look at a National Instruments advertisement and find
the phone number for Switzerland and that's where you will find me.  The
old Email address still works but National Instruments got the rights to
ni.com so the ending switched.  Here is the current address :

This address for Vance is a couple of years old.  Is it already on the

Another person to consult for history is the Doctor - Rich Harabedian,'75.
My memory is pretty fuzzy on this but I thought he may have been in on the
beginning.  I know he was in on official Room 7 SB Bove meetings (count off
by two's) that took place before my years there.

DZ wins the prize!
Yes, the S.B. Bove trophy was created by C. Vance Carter in the Washburn
shops I think during 1978 while he had a student job there.  Vance and I
were roomates during freshman year and joined Mass Delta together and lived
there 1976 through 1979.
I remember the night he presented the new trophy to the House Meeting for
the first time.  Wild applause and instantly adopted as the only true and
official Bove trophy.  I thought he had his initials on the bottom of the
base, but I could be wrong.
The S.B. Bove award already had a history before our time (like DZ said)
but
Vance's design was the first actual trophy I think we had for the award.
We
awarded it each week so there must be huge history of deserving winners by
now.  Maybe Mass Delta needs to consider a ""Bove Lifetime Achievement
Award""?
Vance, since we're all talking about you why don't you add your part of the
history here?

33,,"Cindy,

Several of the traders on the Central Desk have asked me to forward our 
opinions to you regarding the sale of Astros tickets.

First, on Tuesday, March 7, Eva Pao and myself went to get lunch and buy 
Astors tickets at 11:30 A.M.  We walked the entire floor looking for the 
table with the tickets.  It wasn't until later that day we found out the 
tickets were sold out before they were supposed to go on sale (11:00 A.M. on 
Tuesday).

Second, it is extremely difficult for any of the traders or schedulers ",./maildir/lewis-a/all_documents/169.

CTS HOT TODAY...By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 2, Number 209 __________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today is to help
you prepare for the trading day ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (12/13)
--------------------------------------------------------

""Harness the Power of Confluence""

The Websters definition of confluence is;

To come together or flow together like two streams converging
into a river.

For technical trading, confluence is a very powerful concept.
For example, a stochastics crossover from oversold levels has
no statistical significance on its own merit. However, as soon
as you say the trend is up, then entering on the crossover produces
positive results is some markets. Furthermore, let's say the oversold
stochastics has formed while prices are testing major chart support or
perhaps the breakout point of a weekly price pattern or congestion areas.
That's a higher standard of confluence.

For a current example of confluence, let's examine the Canadian dollar;

1. Trend is down as quantified by the CTS trend arrows. (Long and Int.)
2. Correction has unfolded in a text book zig-zag correction that has
retested
the neckline of a massive head and shoulder top as seen on the
weekly chart at 66.00. 3. The zig-zag correction shows A and C are
equal and both break down into 5 legs.
4. Daily stochastics show a trend confirmation sell signal with a clear
failure
point above the neckline.
5. Today's gap lower open has caused daily stochastics to cross and
confirms the entire scenario.

Bringing together two or more technical indicators or observations that
point
in the same direction is called confluence. My experience has shown me that
the more technical evidence I can stack in my corner, the higher the
probability of the desired outcome. Now please, don't
misunderstand what I'm saying. I don't believe accurate technical
analysis on it own produces a high probability
of winning trades. A high probability of winning comes from your exit
strategy.
If you keep your expected profit/loss ratio small, then you will win
on greater than 50% of your trades. However, if you look for the big
ratio (3 to 1 or higher, then
you're doing well to win on anything greater than 35% of your trades.

One of the greatest exercises my Father passed down to me, was using
all charting time frames to establish confluence before taking a trade.

You start with the monthly chart, go to the weekly chart, then to the daily
and
finally the hourly. Write down on each chart what the indicators are saying
and what price patterns have formed. If you find a market that has bullish
evidence
on every time frame, then you have a great candidate for a long entry.

I like taking the CTS Market Selector list of strong trending markets,
and doing a complete monthly chart to 60-minute chart review searching for
confluence. The great trades almost always have substantial evidence from
multiple time frames before unfolding.

Another case and point is Feeders;

The monthly and weekly charts clearly identified a major up trend in
motion and a bullish price pattern several weeks ago. We had confluence on
the daily price patterns and stochastics trend confirmation signals.

Hogs and bellies recently had the same type of confluence and that lead
directly
to my 495 point, $1700 winner in Hogs after commissions winner.

The Yen is another market with major confluence. The downside breakout
of the prior 15-month old trading range was recently followed by a pause.
Since we just took out last weeks low, this pattern now projects major
downside
potential. A quick view of the monthly chart shows the prior multi-year
rally
could be an ABC correction. Can you see the concept of confluence at work
here?

Homework:

Review the list of CTS Market Selector bull markets and find the ones
that have confluence on all time frames (M.W.D.60). Feel free to e-mail me
your observations and I'll respond if you'd like.

Key Technical Developments (close of 12/12)
-------------------------------------------------------
March cotton dropped to new 5-week lows following the
USDA report. The price pattern looks like an island top with
a see through gap. Only a rally above the gap over the next
few trading sessions will turn the technical positive.

March Japanese Yen closed down 61 points and dropped below
last weeks low. A further decline below last weeks low at 90.88
opens the door for a major collapse of 700 to 1000 points.
Hold shorts if you got 'em with stops above last weeks high.

The March Canadian dollar has confirmed our bearish outlook
talked about yesterday. Huge downside potential is seen to the
62.00 level over the next few months. Tomorrow could be a large down
day!

December and February hogs are showing early signs of a short
term climax. Consider taking profits and heading to the sidelines.

************CTS Universe Trader Banks $1700 profit**************

After a flat performance period for the last few weeks, the CTS Universe
Trader
banked a 495 point profit in December Lean hogs. I really like what I'm
seeing
now in several markets and believe a very profitable period for swing
trading
lies dead ahead. Historically, the first quarter has always been
outstanding.

CTS swing trading pinpoints short term high probability trades in the
strongest
trending markets. We essentually look for corrections in the strongest
trending markets which satisfy our set-up conditions. Our goal is to make
$1,000 per month per contract, while keeping our exposure per trade under 5%
of equity based on a 20,000 account. Another goal is to keep our largest
drawdown under 20%.

All the trades for the CTS Universe Trader are traded in a
real-time account so that we report the exact same results
our subscribers get. The account pays a $20.00 round turn commission
rate and is handled by a broker taking the trades off the website the same
time subscibers get the information. To join one of our exclusive CTS
Swing Trader services go the home page at Tradeworld2000.com
to place your order, or simply call us tomorrow morning at 1-800-331-1069
and tell 'em Nick sent ya.

Tiffany walkers?

Recently, in New York, I visited Scott Galloway, the CEO of
Brand Farm, an incubator specializing in e-commerce. Scott
told me his company was ""an incubator before incubators were
cool.""

""Incubators were never cool,"" I said, and he admitted that,
yes, being a retail incubator today is like being a short,
slow basketball player: hard to love. Then he went on to
tell me his business was different. He builds operations
around high-margin categories, doesn't limit sales to
online, and offers what he calls ""edited selection.""

Scott previously launched Red Envelope, a smallish catalog
and site with, to my eyes, wildly overpriced gifts. You pay
for the selection, the packaging, the brand, and the
marketing. It is essentially the Tiffany model.

At Brand Farm, he's developing Gold Violin, a specialty
catalog of luxury gifts for seniors, clearly targeted at
their newly affluent children and grandchildren. Scott is
also working on Room 12, a high-end travel site.

We may snicker at the too-precious products in these
catalogs, but the concept of offering a small number of
compact, beautifully wrapped gifts via multiple channels
sure beats pushing heavy, low-margin bags of dog food on the
Web.

Incubators are not cool. But margins are.

37,Surprise Fed Cut,"You are receiving this e-letter because you

The Fed Cut Rates a half-point today.
Is this just the shock the market needs?

Dear Investor,

Just when you think the Fed is going to leave us
anxiously waiting until their planned meeting in
May...surprise...they go and cut rates a half-point,
today.  And like most investors you're probably
wondering: ""Why did the Fed cut now? and ""What will
this mean for the market?""

To be honest, I'm a little surprised myself at the
Fed's timing.  They've had plenty of opportunities in
the past to cut when the reason seemed crystal clear.
Today, the only insight we have into why the Fed cut
is that they saw some compelling economic data that
justified their action.  And you know what, that's
really all they need to tell us.

Now that a cut's been made the more important story
here is what this will mean for the market. While I
expect this news to bolster consumer confidence a bit
and result in a nice short-term rally, I don't believe
this half-point cut will spell relief for the entire
market for too long.  Corporate earnings are forecast
to be down in the next two quarters and that's going
to take a toll on some of the flagship stocks on Wall
Street.

So while I think a rally is in store...it's going to be
a selective one.  I strongly encourage you to take a
long, hard look at your portfolio now. I believe you
will be making a big mistake if you rely on last
year's winners to excel in this extremely difficult
economic environment.  With the market entering a
short-term upswing, this is a good time to unload some
stocks that just won't go the distance in the months
ahead and replace them with companies who will
continue to produce strong sales and earnings growth
for the remainder of the year.

We're in the midst of earnings season and while the
news from most companies hasn't been good...so far EVERY
single one of the stocks I'm recommending to investors
have surpassed Wall Street's estimates!  And while
many bellwether companies have been reporting
substantial DECLINES in their sales and profits, the
companies on my buy list are growing their sales and
profits by more than 100% on average. These are the
kind of fundamentally superior stocks that are going
to truly reward investors in the months ahead.

If you don't know where to find these companies, I can
help.  My team and I scour the market every day to
find these proven winners, and we have a track record
of 28% gains in the last 18 months that shows our
strategy produces PROFITS-no matter what the market
environment.

I'd like to share our complete list of stocks with you
today. Sign up for this special offer to my BLUE CHIP
GROWTH service today--RISK-FREE for SIX months--and
I'll give you immediate access to our complete Buy
List of stocks to get you started right away.

First, why does the Dell public website have more choices for upgrades then 
the Enron website?  For example, the website available to the public has a 
19"" monitor (M991) for an extra $140.

Second, why is Dell charging Enron employees more for the same products it 
offers to the general public?  For example, the website available to the 
public allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor for $290.  
The Enron website allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor 
for $400.  Therefore, Enron employees are being charged an extra $110 for the 
same upgrade.

		Dec. 11, 2000 Volume 5.50
		
		
		Letter from the editor
		
		We're always tinkering with one area of the site or another trying to make it 
better. 
		
		This week, we've made some rather significant changes to the Deaths page on 
the site. And we're working on several more. 
		
		For starters, we've combined the pages with the news articles and the local 
death notices from the Classifieds section into a single page. This way, you 
get to all of the daily information we have all at once. 
		
		In addition to the obituaries and death notices, we've added links to 
additional resources both for genealogical purposes and for those needing to 
make plans for a funeral. We'll add more links in this area as they become 
available. For instance, there's a link for an online search of birth and 
death records for Harris County now -- but not for the City of Houston or for 
the State of Texas. Those latter two governmental units don't provide online 
searches of their records yet. When they do, we'll add the links. And, yes, 
we are working to include Mic Barnette's Saturday column on genealogy from 
the newspaper. 
		
		The page still has a search box for the local death notices (and other 
funerary categories) from the Classifieds section, but we don't think you 
will need it very often. We are listing all of the local notices being 
published each day on the page now, and we've included links on the left side 
navigation of the page for notices from the entire week just passed. 
		
		There's still a lot of hand work and construction going on here; so please be 
patient with us. We don't have a real search engine in this area yet; so we 
are going to try to rearrange the file by hand each morning so the notices 
are listed in alphabetical order. (Occasionally, other tasks will push this 
work back and it will not happen as early as either of us would like, which 
is why we also are working on a routine to make the computers do this job.) 
		
		Another ongoing programming task for this page is to develop a true archives 
database and search for the local notices we have saved by hand online going 
back to October of 1997. However, until this task is completed, you can 
search for past notices through a two-step precess. We have a surname index 
for all of the death notices in the Chronicle's archives system; so you can 
use the archives gateway to determine whether or not a notice was published 
for a particular individual and when. Once knowing the date the notice was 
published, you can see if we saved it online by using a special URL --
		
		http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/content/chronicle/deaths/YY/MM/DD/deaths.html
		
		where ""YY"" is a two-digit year (like 97, 99, 00, etc.), ""MM"" is a two-digit 
month (like 01, 07, 11, etc.) and ""DD"" is a two-digit date (like 01, 09, 18, 
23, etc.). We know this is cumbersome, which is why we are working on a 
better way of doing it, but this will work to get to the past notices we do 
have until then. 
		
		Thanks for visiting, and please party carefully so we don't find your name on 
the new Deaths page this season.

		What's New at HoustonChronicle.com
		
		Shopping Online
		It only seems that shopping is the reason for the season at this time of 
year. 
		
		We try to a measure of balance on both our Holidays and Religion pages, but 
this is the major shopping period of every year. 
		
		But we would be remiss if we didn't try to do our part to help keep the 
economy moving along; so we would like to take this opportunity to point out 
the Chronicle e-shops area of the site in case you haven't looked it over 
before. 
		
		Chronicle e-shops is a partnership with Point & Shop on Houston 
Chronicle.com. It's an online shopping area offering merchandise from 
businesses throughout the country, quickly and reliably available for 
delivery before Christmas right from the convenience of your Web browser. 
		
		Election Without End
		Yes, another week is gone and the Florida vote that will determine who the 
next president will be still is up in the air. Right now, we're all waiting 
on a U.S. Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Monday on whether or not to 
allow a recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court.  
		
		So far the George W. Bush organization has been successful in fighting off 
vote recounts that might show that Al Gore won the Florida vote, and time may 
now be the Bush campaign's strongest argument. With each passing day, the 
time required for a manual recount gets squeezed tighter and tighter. Also, 
the Florida Legislature will be meeting this week to consider naming its own 
slate of delegates, which inevitably would be pledged to Bush since the 
Florida Legislature is overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans. 
		
		If Bush gets the Florida electors, he will win the presidency by two votes -- 
271-269 -- in the Electoral College. 
		
		We're as confused as anybody, but we'll keep posting the latest developments 
on the Election & Politics page. 
		
		High School Football
		And you thought the election was endless... 
		
		Katy will be playing in the 5A Division II semifinals next Saturday in 
College Station as the only Houston-area team still working on a state title. 
But both Bay City and LaGrange have some Houston following, along with teams 
from West Orange-Stark and even Corpus Christi and San Antonio.  
		
		And we'll keep following along on the High School Sports page in the Sports 
section of the site until the very last down is played.

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself 
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high

I remember you mentioned that you and your friends were planning a trip. 
This website is offered by the Tourism Authority of Thailand.? I took a 
look at it, and thought that it was good.? I would even use it to lure my 
boyfriend to visit home with me next year.

THE JANUARY EFFECT DID IT START THIS SPRING? by  Kansas City Board of Trade,
Kansas City, Missouri

(December, 2000) When we embarked into the year 2000, industry analysts
questioned whether the phenomenon known as the January Effect would occur as
many changes were in store. There were many questions about Y2K and any
technical glitches that might appear. Thankfully, there were not any
problems, but a very different year was in store for the markets...

PARTIAL OUTLINE OF FEATURED ARTICLES IN CURRENT ISSUE OF CONSENSUS FUTURES
AND FINANCIAL WEEKLY:


WILL THE ELECTION EVER END?  by AIC Investment Advisors, Inc.

(December 4, 2000) For millions of Americans familiar with hotly contested
presidential election campaigns and then the concession speech by the loser,
either election night or the following day, the current morass in Florida is
astonishing. Surrounded by seemingly battalions of lawyers of whom many are
nothing more than town-hall hangers-on, the battle in various courts seems to
stretch to the horizon...


SOYBEAN PRICES: HEADED HIGHER by Richard A. Brock  & Associates, Inc.

(December 1, 2000) Despite the fact a record amount of soybeans were
harvested in both North and South America in 2000, and Brazil and Argentina
are both set to produce another record crop, soybean prices have been working
higher the past few weeks. How can prices move higher if the world is awash
in soybeans?..

OPTIONS FOCUS by Salomon Smith Barney

(November 2000) Stock index futures and options provide investors with
efficient tools to help minimize losses in a declining stock market. If the
price correlation of a stock portfolio and the index futures used as a hedge
is high, the risk on that equity portion protected by the futures could be
neutralized or its exposure reduced against the effects of a market decline
or advance...

QUALCOMM Announces ICC Arbitration Decision Regarding Royalty Dispute
with ETRI

SAN DIEGO, Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq:QC=
OM)
today announced that the International Court of Arbitration (ICA) of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has issued its decision and award
arising from the arbitration between QUALCOMM and the Korean Electronics an=

As a result of the award by the ICC, QUALCOMM will report, in its first fis=

and
other costs for the period from inception of the Joint Development Agreemen=

ordered
that QUALCOMM continue to share with ETRI a part of the royalties that=20

receives only on sales of certain Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)=20
equipment

expected to have little impact, on the order of $4 million per quarter=20

[IMAGE]Announcing a brand-new Special Report by America's #1 stock picker....


Dear Investor, 


Louis Navellier, the financial advisor who has helped his subscribers beat 
the market more than 3-to-1 over the past three years, has just completed a 
Special Report I thought you'd want to know about. 

Called Wall Street's Next Big Blue Chip Winners, this report reveals Louis' 
market-beating strategy for choosing the right stocks and explains how you 
can position your portfolio for tremendous profits -- even in today's tough 
market conditions. Plus, it details 8 powerful stocks that are set to reap 
you fast profits:

The top software blue-chip of the Internet age. This company has quickly 
become the global leader in ""firewall protection."" Simply put, firewalls keep 
hackers and viruses out... keeping corporate networks secure. And that is a 
huge growth business. This company's sales should reach $425 million this 
years, a 93% increase over last. And there's no slowdown in sight. The time 
is right for you to get in for great gains in the upcoming months!
The ""most surprising"" company on Wall Street. Analysts keep getting the 
profit forecasts wrong, wrong, wrong! But that's no surprise to anyone inside 
the technology  industry. While chipmakers like Intel and AMD battle over 
shrinking markets, this dynamic innovator carved out the leadership position 
in high-tech's ""next big thing."" As demand shifts from deskbound PCs to  new 
Internet technologies, this company owns the most lucrative high-bandwidth 
markets... positioning itself (and you if you invest right away) in the sweet 
spot of the technology boom. 
Money-doubler in 4 to 6 months? The potential is certainly there -- and that 
may prove to be a very conservative target. This company has developed one of 
the most important medical devices of the last 20 years. And the lucrative 
markets for its products grow wider every day. Don't miss out!
Plus 5 more rock-solid companies with great profit-making potential!

Each one of these companies is on a record-setting roll -- stealing market 
share like mad... recording staggering sales and profit gains... and setting 
new productivity standards in its industry. And each company's stock is 
likely to soar 25%, 50% or more over the next 2 to 4 months alone. 

There's no time to waste. Click on the link below to request your copy of 
Wall Street's Next Big Blue Chip Winners -- it's FREE with your no-risk trial 
to Louis Navellier's Blue Chip Growth service.

As soon as we hear from you, we'll rush you your FREE copy of this valuable 
report. You'll then have all the names of these companies Louis is 
recommending today -- and the strategy it'll take to make big profits from 
them.

Sincerely --

Howard Present

COMMENT: The Money Laundering Farce Must End
by Bob Bauman, Editor.

One of the major arguments of the world money police is the imagined
need to stop ""money laundering."" They claim widespread abuse of banking
and other financial systems by sinister criminal forces. Offering little
proof, artful officials use their questionable premise to justify a
supposed right to monitor and record all financial transactions. By
design, banks and their employees have been forced into the unwanted
role of spies and police deputies.

In the only popular uprising against this arrogant attack on financial
privacy, in 1999 protests from hundreds of thousands of irate Americans
forced the US government to back down on so-called ""Know Your Customer""
rules. The KYC proposals would have made every American banker a
government vetting agent, with a duty to investigate, watch for and
report supposed ""suspicious activity"" of all account holders. (Since
then the Clinton administration has pressed banks to adopt ""voluntary""
KYC rules in spite of these protests).

From earliest history, unless restrained, governments always have used
every available tool to spy on citizens. Until this trumped up money
laundering scare the consensus in western democracies has been that
personal freedom and privacy greatly outweighed prior restrictions
aimed at potential criminal abuse. This established principle rightly
forced police and prosecutors to build each individual case on legally
gathered evidence rather than use the dragnet approach.

But now prosecutors reverse this traditional right to privacy. Instead
of a presumption of innocence, whole classes of people are viewed as
potential criminals based solely on wealth and its free use. Subject to
civil forfeiture, the accused are stripped of their assets and forced
to prove their innocence.

Are these drastic restrictions on financial freedom justified?

Existing anti-ML efforts have proven very costly and highly ineffective.
In the US in 1998, only 932 people were convicted of money laundering,
yet the cost to the private and public sectors exceeded $10 billion,
averaging more than $10 million per conviction. Based on several years
statistics, a British law professor calculated that the UK government
has stopped only 0.004% of the criminal money that flowed through the
City of London. The professor concluded: ""Money launderers do not have
a statistically significant chance of being caught, hence the deterrent
effect of such laws is negligible.""

The question must be asked: ""When is this madness to stop?"" No one
should ever have to justify he right to keep their personal business
private, except upon an individual indictment based on specific facts
presented to a court of law.

This financial dragnet must end. A continuing and expanded popular
resistance holds the key to success.

Under Thornton May's name, on his Guardent business card, is
a Fast Company-esque title: ""Corporate Futurist and Chief
Awareness Officer."" As if it's possible to not be aware of
Thornton.

He's unignorable, a kinetic public speaker and staccato
conversationalist. These are good traits, given what he's
trying to drum up awareness for: Guardent's service of
building secure information infrastructures.

Most security services (monitoring services, hackers-for-
hire, etc.) generally don't probe the weakest links in any
system: the people. Thornton's out to educate a whole class
of IT professionals about human behavior -- what to look for
in on-staff security risks, and how to behave with other
professionals so as to better exchange information about
security.

Sounds like a great consulting gig, but Thornton is very
dismissive of consultants. He claims that Guardent's 160
people are, in fact, hyperspecialists on security, and that
Guardent is one of a new kind of company that will rise from
the ashes of the great e-consulting washout: focused, best-
of-breed, expert organizations. The challenge to come, he
says, will be the corporate customer's who, fed up with
broad but shallow consulting firms, will have to learn how
to tightly integrate contracted, fanatical specialists into
their own teams.

I remember you mentioned that you and your friends were planning a trip.  
This website is offered by the Tourism Authority of Thailand.  I took a look

AMCC First to Enable the Next Generation Multi-Carrier, Transparent
Network Architecture With Introduction of 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC
Device=0F=3DAMCC's Hudson is the Industry's First Device to Meet the Rapidl=
y=20
Growing
Demand for 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man, Transport and WD=
M
Sectors

SAN DIEGO, Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AM=
CC)
(Nasdaq:AMCC), a leader in high-bandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo=
r=20
the
world's optical networks, today announced the Hudson (S19203), the industry=
's
first 10 Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G.709
digital wrapper standard and traditional SONET/SDH infrastructures.

The Hudson variable rate, digital wrapper framer/deframer and performance
monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols
across the network, while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers.
Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction (FEC) for rates u=
p=20
to
10.66 Gbps and supports OC-192 transmission standards. The digital wrapper
technology provides an extension of the current SONET/SDH infrastructure,=
=20
while
enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network. The Hudson
easily interfaces with AMCC's 10 Gbps mux/demux devices, SONET/SDH/digital
wrapper backplane devices and AMCC's mapping and pointer processing devices=
.

""The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks =
as=20
it
incorporates the best features of SONET/SDH while removing some of the rigi=
d
overhead structure that makes SONET/SDH sub-optimal for an IP-centric,
intelligent optical network,"" said Brent Little, vice president of marketin=
g=20
for
AMCC. ""By using key devices such as Hudson, OEMs will now be able to create=
=20
more
efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch.""

AMCC's digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major=
=20
wide
area networking (WAN) equipment manufacturers. The demand for digital wrapp=
er
products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple
protocols at 10 Gbps, coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi=
dth
across today's multiple-carrier network.

""The Hudson is built for the next-generation multi-carrier transport networ=
k
architecture and ushers in an efficient and cost-effective means of=20
transporting
traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures,"" said Ken Prentiss,
AMCC's director of marketing for telecom products. ""We are seeing=20
unprecedented
demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the device's
flexible architecture; customers can wrap, unwrap or monitor traditional
SONET/SDH traffic, or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl=
e
device.""

The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing
frames into ""super-frames,"" which can then be more efficiently managed with=
 a
relatively small allocation of overhead-per-byte of data. By aggregating
together the provisions for ""framing bits"" that are already defined for use=
 by
existing time-division multiplexed (TDM) structures, the super-frame concep=
t
allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation, administration a=
nd
maintenance (OAM) capability without materially expanding the amount of dat=
a
currently being transmitted. This creative use of available control bits al=
so
allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital
wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth
usage.

The Hudson's core logic runs on a 1.8V power supply and features two input =
and
two output ports, which are configurable in many ways. Figure 1 shows a=20
typical
network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp=
ut
and output lines. The input and output ports can be configured as a dual
redundant I/O on a single data stream for protection switching or as two
completely independent data streams for duplex operation. Either input port=
=20
can
be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing.

The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature=
s
Optical Channel Overhead (OCh-OH) insertion and extraction, which are
independently controllable. All 64 OCh-OH bytes in a superframe are=20
programmable
in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or
microprocessor. Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional=
ly
differentially decoded and encoded, deframed and framed, descrambled and
scrambled, and decoded and encoded with FEC information. In addition, SONET=
=20
data
can optionally be performance monitored for integrity, alarms, and trace
messages.


Pricing and Availability

The Hudson (S19203), packaged in a 624-pin CBGA, will be sampling to=20
development
partners in December with volume production commencing in Q2 2001. AMCC=20
solution
set pricing can be obtained from the company by calling 800/755-AMCC
(800/755-2622).

Anti-Tax Haven Sanctions - What Happens If There Is All Out War?
by Bob Bauman, Editor

We're getting weary of writing about the OECD and FATF blacklists
and those ""sanctions"" that supposedly will be clamped on world tax
havens, come June 30. That was the Paris bureaucrats' self-inflicted
deadline chosen a year back when they believed CLINTON-GORE (remember
them?) leftist Treasury minions would be in control in Washington, DC.

Last June these nervy public relations megaphones for the rich G-7
nations issued arbitrary lists of small nations they accused of being
lax on criminal money laundering and/or engaged in nefarious ""harmful
tax competition.""

Then, and repeatedly since, the Blacklisted Ones have been threatened
with nebulous ""sanctions,"" possibly including severance from world
banking and financial systems. As co-conspirators, the Clinton crowd
at the US Treasury tried and failed to get congressional approval for
this obtuse thuggery. Now a new president named Bush is more or less
in control, and still we wait for what should be an easy & resounding
official ""NO"" to the OECD high tax cartel. Absent the US, there's
little chance the OECD can impose any meaningful ""sanctions,"" however
much the bureaucrat bullies bluster.

But what might sanctions look like? How disruptive could they be,
if they were indeed imposed on the 35 blacklisted offshore nations.

Sovereign Society advisory board member J. Richard DUKE
(http://www.assetlaw.com) calls attention to a 2 part article in the
April and May issues of the Journal of International Taxation,
(available only to subscribers on line). There New York attorney
David E. Spencer provides a glimpse of the chaos that could result
in world financial markets if the OECD has its perverse way by
imposing sanctions on ""uncooperative"" tax haven nations.

Among the OECD suggested sanctions nations might impose;
* use of domestic tax laws to deny all deductions, exemptions,
allowances and credits for taxpayers or entities doing business in
haven nations;
* under civil and criminal penalties, require new, extensive reporting
of all offshore financial activity;
* expansion and strict enforcement of controlled foreign corporation
(CFC) rules;
* levy new withholding taxes on payments or transfers to havens;
* increased tax audits of all offshore business activity;
* review, repeal and/or refusal of bilateral tax treaties;
* special new tariffs on financial activity involving haven nations.

In the case of the US and most other nations, all of these radical
proposals would require legislative action that is highly unlikely to
occur. But imagine what this would do to the international financial
world as we now know it. June 30, here we come!

Microsoft Case Settled! No, the Other One

Some former Microsoft ""permatemps"" will have a little extra dough to
pay off their holiday Visa bills. Microsoft will pay about $97 million
to compensate 8,000 to 12,000 long-term temporary employees for the
stock-purchase plan they never had.

A spate of outlets ran the AP's coverage, including the allegation
that Microsoft's employment practices ""once allowed employees to be
classified as temporary for as long as 14 years."" (Temporary in the
Buddhist, ""all is transitory"" way, we assume). The average assignment
was 10 months, MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters. MS officials
also insisted that many temps don't want to go on payroll, since they
like the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better. The
Washington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MS
temps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired. As
for the money, ""How many stories have you ever seen about high-tech
contractors retiring at 35 because they made millions of dollars?"" a
former two-year temp asked the AP. ""If I had had access to what
everyone else had, I would be in the same financial situation as a
number of friends who are already retired,"" another former temp
complained to TechWeb.

Not that this is all about the bucks, some former permatemps said:
Microsoft hurt their feelings. They ""had to wear orange badges, while
regular employees wore blue badges"" and couldn't go to office parties
or shop at the discounted company store, said the New York Times. Nor
could they use the corporate health club, added the Washington Post's
writers, who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolic
orange badges. ""This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side,""
one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News. ""You were
trying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a second-class
citizen."" Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably went
through junior high.

To get a better sense of the eight-year legal wrangling surrounding
this case, peruse the New York Times, the Washington Post and the
Seattle Times. Basically, it comes down to this: Legal eagles say it's
not nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them into
the stock purchase plan, but temps are on their own for health
insurance. Microsoft got the hint in the mid-'90s, told contractors to
take at least 100 days off after sticking around for 12 months, let
about 3,000 employees trade their orange badges for blue ones, and
hooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits. So maybe MS
temps get that health insurance after all, but ""the company still
doesn't give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at a
discount,"" said the Merc.

Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to high-tech and
the business world in general, but the Seattle Times found a
contrarian. ""One thing that has been noteworthy is there haven't been
a large number of cases that have been filed (in the wake of the
Microsoft case),"" said the general counsel of the American Staffing
Association. Nor will the case have ""a material impact on our
results,"" said MS spokesman Matt Pilla. That $97 million won't make a
dent, but they can't let their contractors into the company store? -

Hackers Get Final Y2K Jollies

The year that started with widespread paranoia and uneasiness seems
poised to end that way, too. As if wobbly tech companies weren't
enough to make everyone nervous, hackers have come out to play.

In the ""clich,s come to life"" department, a hacker stole a database of
credit card numbers from Creditcard.com and posted the numbers online.
Creditcards.com, a b-to-b site that helps Web retailers accept credit
card payments, told ZDNet the hacker did his deed on Monday. The
company told MSNBC, however, that the suspect broke in four months ago
and has been trying to extort Creditcards.com ever since. That wasn't
the only communications mix-up: The firm never told its customers
about the breach. Creditcards.com also claimed that there was no
evidence of credit card fraud, but MSNBC ""was able to find a potential
victim within a few moments of seeing the database"" - an Illinois
woman billed for $350 worth of WWF merchandise en route to the
Philippines. Here's a washcloth, Creditcards.com. You've got some egg
on your face.

In a less serious but equally embarrassing prank, a naughty photo or
two appeared on the Web site of Japan's National Police Agency. ""At
this point, nothing has been concluded, only that it was not caused by
a virus,"" an NPA spokesperson told the AP. There's no evidence of a
break-in, said Japan's Daily Yomiuri, so maybe visitors were just
redirected to a bogus site. Nobody can agree on what sorts of
revealing photos were used, let alone the technical details.

Worry about a hack attack at the University of Washington Medical
Center - reported as early as Saturday in the Washington Post, Seattle
Times, and Wall Street Journal - ought to get new life from a piece in
Tuesday's USA Today. Not only can a successful hacker download
confidential medical information, said writer Greg Farrell, ""medical
records are a veritable treasure trove for those who would make the
patients victims of identity theft."" Yet another hazard of the U.S.
health-care system.

Finally, Business Week regaled its executive readership with tales of
embittered employees taking revenge via malicious hacking. ""Insider
hacking"" causes $1 billion in damage to U.S. businesses each year,
said Business Week's Dennis Blank, and represents 70 percent of all
attacks. Maybe Microsoft should be glad its disgruntled permatemps
only sued. - Jen Muehlbauer

You Can't Always Get What You Want

Is that Wednesday's news theme for everyone but George Bush? Al Gore
is the most obvious choice to lead the disappointed, but techies
coming up short include Compaq and Razorfish (earnings warnings) and
Ask Jeeves (layoffs). Then there are those wireless licenses, the
auction of which produced a frenzy of interest and money in Europe but
stateside are much more modest affairs, and that's a disappointment
for the FCC.

Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories, what with online
sales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay. The high-priced bids on
wireless licenses, however, seem to make the media's eyes glaze over.
The Wall Street Journal reminded that wireless-license auctions raised
$30 billion in the U.K. and $40 billion-plus in Germany. The U.S.
auction, which kicked off Tuesday, is estimated to churn up a mere $15
billion to $20 billion, and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst told
the Journal that $12 billion sounds more likely.

Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get what's going on.
The Bloomberg posting on News.com helpfully explained that carriers
are using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps in
coverage, especially in major metropolitan areas. The Journal chimed
in (eventually) that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef up
their coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls. That's
why, of the 422 licenses covering 195 local markets, the hottest
action was for hopping markets such as New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago. So far the total bids are up to $501.2 million after two
rounds, the FCC told outlets. The highest bids have been $38.2 million
each by Sprint and DCC PCS, a subsidiary of Dobson Communications, for
licenses in New York City. L.A. was runner-up, with Salmon and Verizon
both bidding $25.5 million for licenses in that market.

The Financial Times blamed the absence ""of ruinously expensive
spectrum auctions"" on this side of the Atlantic on ""the relative
backwardness of mobile telephony in the U.S."" The pricey auctions in
Europe have been for fancy 3G wireless licenses, while the U.S. is
still peddling local markets. Expect ""a proper 3G auction"" to follow
here in two years, the peach paper wrote. A jump in third-quarter
churn rates among telco companies signals that competition is starting
to bite, the Lex Column warned. The high-priced ""auction risk""
remains, Lex warned, but don't expect much. Even if you try sometimes,
you still won't get what you need. - Deborah Asbrand

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's closed lower on Wednesday as
chip and hardware stocks fell due to concerns over corporate profits.
Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating on the chip equipment group,
citing a capital-spending freeze of up to six months at Intel. The
Dow closed higher on Wednesday due in part to strength in Philip
Morris, J.P. Morgan and Johnson & Johnson. Early strength tested last
week's high crossing at 10,917.30, which marks short-term resistance.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would open the door for a
possible year end rally that could lead to an eventual test of last
spring's high crossing at 11,425.40 later this winter.

INTEREST RATES March bonds gapped up and surged to a new contract
high thereby renewing this fall's rally. Weakness in the Nasdaq and
S&P's underpinned today's rally in bonds in part due to a safe-haven
move by some investors. Today's high-range close sets the stage for
sharply higher prices on Thursday should November's Producer Price
Index come in weaker than expected. If the rally in March bonds
continues, weekly resistance crossing at 106-10 is the next upside
objective later this winter.

CRB INDEX extended Tuesday's loss and confirmed a downside breakout
below the lower boundary of this month's symmetrical triangle and
filled November's gap at 227.58. Today's decline confirms the rally
off the late-October low has come to an end while marking a broad
double top on the daily chart. If the decline continues, fib support
crossing at 225.87 is the next downside target. Much of today's
pressure was due to weakness in precious metals, foods, fiber, and
energies.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to
liquidation of Brent crude oil ahead of Thursday's January contract
expiration. The sell off was some what of a surprise following recent
industry data, which showed crude and heating oil stocks fell last
week and indications that Iraq has not fully resumed crude oil sales.
February crude oil posted a key reversal down today thereby ending
this week's short covering rebound. Additional weakness on Thursday
is needed to confirm today's reversal pattern. If this fall's decline
resumes, fib support crossing at 27.37 is the next target. February
heating oil also closed sharply lower on Wednesday and is challenging
key support crossing at 88.10. Multiple closes below this support
level could lead to a test of the 38% retracement level of the
1999/2000- advance crossing at 84.11 later this winter.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar closed higher on Wednesday as it renewed
its short covering rebound off last week's low. Today's rally was
underpinned by Tuesday's U.S. Supreme Court decision to halt the
manual recount thereby giving the election to George W. Bush.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling sideways to higher
prices into the end of the year are possible. Today's mid-range close
leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. The March
Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on Wednesday as they extend their
declines off last week's highs. Momentum indicators have turned
bearish warning additional weakness into the end of the year is
possible. The March Japanese Yen plunged to a new contract low in
overnight trading and held onto those losses during the day session.
Concerns over the Japanese economy and the U.S. Supreme Court ruling
triggered the sell off. The door is open for a test of last
February's low crossing at .8978 then fib support crossing at .8774
later this winter.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed lower on Wednesday. February gold resumed
its decline off last week's high and closed below November's uptrend
line crossing near 271.80 thereby confirming a short-term top has
been posted. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to
lower prices into the end of the year are possible. Support begins at
266.80. March silver also closed lower on Wednesday ending this
week's short covering bounce. Today's new low close for the week and
test of support crossing at 4.69 sets the stage for additional
weakness into the end of the year. If the decline continues, weekly
support crossing at 4.56 cents is March's next target. March copper
extended Tuesday's loss in relatively narrow trading but pulled up
short of testing November's uptrend line crossing near 87.75. A short
covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses
leaving the door open for additional short covering on Thursday.
Nevertheless, momentum indicators are overbought and turning bearish
signaling additional weakness near-term is possible. Closes below
November's uptrend line would confirm a top and trend change has
taken place.

GRAINS closed mixed on Wednesday. March corn posted a key reversal up
Wednesday due to expectations that tomorrow's export sales report
will show a significant improvement from recent weeks. Confirmation
of improving export sales on Thursday could lead to further short
covering thereby turning a number of momentum indicators neutral to
bullish. Such a turnaround in the near-term price outlook could lead
to year-end rebound however, it will take closes above 2.22 1/4
before a low is confirmed. March wheat closed lower on Wednesday as
traders are struggling to find direction following Tuesday's key
reversal down in the face of a friendly supply and demand report.
Traders remain concerned over lagging export sales and expect to see
another week of slow export sales in Thursday's report. March is
challenging trading range support crossing at 2.69. If this support
level is broken, the fall low at 2.63 1/2 then long-term support at
2.50 are possible targets. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling
additional weakness is possible.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Wednesday. March beans managed to
squeak out a fractional gain on Wednesday as it continues to
consolidate below the 75% retracement level of this fall's decline,
which crosses at 5.20. While Tuesday's supply and demand report was
friendly, the increase in export sales and drop in carryout was
already factored into prices. March beans are at a crossroads as a
lack of fresh news is limiting gains while solid demand continues to
underpin the market. Closes above 5.20 or below trendline support
crossing near 5.12 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market. March soybean meal closed slightly lower on Wednesday due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its recent gains.
March continues to extend the late-fall trading range despite
Tuesday's friendly supply and demand report. Closes above 189.50 or
below 182.30 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market. March bean oil posted an inside day with a slightly higher
close due to light short covering as it consolidated some of this
week's losses. However, today's low-range close leaves the door open
for a resumption of the decline off this month's high. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling a test of November's low crossing at
15.05 is possible later this winter.

LIVESTOCK closed steady on Wednesday. February hogs posted a quiet
inside day with a steady close as it consolidated some of Tuesday's
loss. However, momentum indicators are diverging and turning bearish
warning traders that a broad double top may have been posted with
Monday's spike high. A resumption of this week's decline on Thursday
would set the stage for a test of trendline support crossing near
57.50. If the late fall rally resumes, weekly resistance crossing at
63.30 is the next upside target. February cattle also closed steady
after early strength tied to winter storm concerns and expectations
for higher cash bids gave way to light profit taking ahead of the
close. Today's high fell short of testing weekly resistance crossing
at 77.92. Momentum indicators have become very overbought warning
traders that much of the bullish news from higher cash and product
prices underpinned by surprisingly strong demand may have already
been discounted in prices. Closes below Tuesday's low at 76.50 would
be a clear warning to bulls that a short-term top may be in or near.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Thursday. March coffee posted
another quiet inside day with its lowest close ever while May fell
within 20 cents of the contract low. Forecast for rain across
Brazil's coffee growing region this weekend combined with last week's
bearish world crop estimate continues to weigh on prices. March cocoa
gave us the short covering bounce we were looking for following
Tuesday's high-range close. Additional short covering is possible
however, upside potential appears limited in the face of continued
origin selling that may last into the end of the year. March sugar
finally resumed its decline off November's high after drifting
sideways for the past week and a half. Renewed fund and speculator
selling due to a lack of cash trade activity triggered today's plunge
to new lows. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to
lower prices are possible. If the decline continues 930, then 867 are
the next targets. March cotton extended Tuesday's trendline breakout
thereby confirming this week's gap marked a downside breakaway gap.
Today's loss sets the stage for a likely test of October's low
crossing at 63.75 cents later this winter. Bearish fallout from
Tuesday's negative supply and demand report continues to weigh on
prices. I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on
Thursday especially if export sales come in above pre-report
expectations.

Where are you nowadays?

Where have you been?

What have you seen?

Inquiring minds want to know!

I don't know if you have corresponded with Flet lately, but he is officially 
a short timer.  Looks like he's the proud owner of Midwest Power now that 
John Z. has taken off for the Great White North (Calgary).

On a completely different note, Sandra is still waiting for her postcards.  
Apparently you promised to send a postcard every week or something.

Oh, by the way, Martin and Kevin are officially married now.  And Robin is in 
Toronto awaiting the fateful day.

That's about all for now.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

91,Oracle Beats the Tech Trend,"?
EarningsWhispers.com is Barron's Favorite Source for  Earnings Information

Fundamentals Always Prevail: These 14 Stocks Will  Prove It
Since 1994, Alvin Toral averaged a whopping +79.3% yearly. His  secret? 
""Fundamentals always prevail"": booming revenues and earnings, reasonable  
P/Es, strong cash flow. He just said ""buy"" to 14 fundamentally-solid stocks. 
Get  this FREE Report:
http://www.investools.com/c/go/PFUN/WHISP-pfunTB1?s=S601  


Despite an onslaught of earnings warnings from tech  companies lately, the 
consensus expectation for Oracle (ORCL) is for  at least a penny earnings 
surprise and possibly a two-cent positive  surprise.

Bert Hochfeld at Josephthal & Co., one of the more accurate  analysts 
following Oracle, is one of two analysts that have an official earnings  
estimate of $0.11 per share. Mr. Hochfeld told clients recently that the 
company  would meet his expectations with strong U.S. sales offset by 
disappointing  European sales.?

The consensus among the 28 analysts is for Oracle  to earn $0.10 per share on 
revenue of just under $2.7 billion, yet even the more  conservative analysts 
are optimistic. Gretchen Teagarden at Salomon Smith Barney  is one of the few 
analysts with an estimate below $0.10 per share, but her  revenue estimate is 
slightly above the consensus revenue estimate.

On  Tuesday Chris Shilakes at Merrill Lynch told clients that he is 
projecting  earnings of $0.10 per share on revenue of $2.68 billion. However, 
he added that  revenue might be slightly better than his projections and 
Oracle's continued  improvement with operating margins should lead to 
earnings of $0.11 to $0.12 per  share.?

Last week Jim Pickrel at Chase H & Q told clients that  he expects the 
company to meet or beat his earnings estimate of $0.10 per share  and revenue 
estimate of $2.6 billion. He stated that Oracle's ""pipeline appears  robust"" 
and that the company should achieve 52% revenue growth or better in its  
applications business.

The pressing issues regarding Oracle among the  analysts are next quarter and 
the recent management turnover. Mr. Pickrel stated  Oracle's Senior Vice 
President Gary Bloom's departure would not have much of an  impact, but 
turnover in other key management positions is an issue. Yet, the  recent pact 
with CitiGroup (C) adds some  confidence in the current team. Richard Davis 
at Needham & Co. told clients  recently that this quarter would be fine but 
still downgraded Oracle's stock  because of the departure of Bloom and Senior 
Vice President Ray Lane reduces the  company's earnings visibility and may 
encourage others to leave the company as  well.

Mr. Upin said that Oracle could have a tough February quarter and  could see 
its toughest test of its performance in the applications space in the  May 
quarter. Yet, overall the analysts like the stock and believe the recent  
stock price is a buying opportunity.?

As result, the company will  need to at least meet or beat the $0.11 Earnings 
Whisper number and provide the  analysts comfort with the current management 
team and the upcoming quarters. If  this can be accomplished during the 
conference call on Thursday, some analysts  believe the stock could reach $35 
in the very near term. You may listen to  Oracle's conference call at 
http://www.nasdaq.com/reference/broadcast_oracle.htm  beginning at 5:30 PM ET 
on Thursday.

92,Re: FW: Hello,"Hey,

It has been awfully busy now that I'm managing both Gas Daily and 
Mid-continent Basis.  Luckily, the market has settled down and given me a 
chance to get up to speed.

Needless to say, I haven't been to any happy hours either.  I did get to go 
to an Astros game with Natsource a few weeks ago, however.  If I hear of 
anything I will let you know.

Anyway, looks like it's about quitting time.

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's posted inside days with lower
closes. Light pressure came from some negative pre- announcements on
earnings in tech stocks that led to today's consolidation. The March
S&P is consolidating just below trendline resistance crossing near
1410. The March Nasdaq has broken out above this fall's downtrend
line crossing near 2900 thereby hinting a bottom and trend change may
be in place. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling sideways to
higher prices in both markets are possible near-term. Meanwhile, the
Dow closed modestly higher as it extends its rebound off last
Thursday's low. Closes above 10,917.30 are needed to extend this
month's rebound into the end of the year.

INTEREST RATES March bonds closed modestly higher on the day due to a
late-session short covering rebound triggered by today's decline in
the Nasdaq. Trading remains choppy, as the market is nervous over the
much-anticipated ruling by the Supreme Court that should decide the
outcome of the U.S. Presidential election. March bonds are
challenging November's uptrend line crossing near 102- 28. Multiple
closes below this support level would all but confirm a top and trend
change has taken place. Closes above last week's high at 104 are
needed to resume the late-fall rally.

CRB INDEX closed sharply lower on Tuesday pressured by weakness in
heating oil, unleaded gas, cotton, foods, and grains. The CRB has
been range bound following last Monday's strong rally and appears to
be forming a possible symmetrical triangle. A breakout in either
direction of this consolidation pattern should lead to a trending
move in the direction of the breakout. Momentum indicators are
neutral to bearish warning traders that a broad double top with
October's high also appears to be forming.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed mixed on Tuesday as February crude
oil closed slightly higher while the product markets were lower
following the release of bearish API (American Petroleum Institute)
data, which showed gasoline and distillate stocks including heating
oil building. Nevertheless, the oversold condition of the energy
complex has left the doors open for a short covering rebound into the
end of the year especially if Iraq continues its oil embargo while
negotiating over price with the United Nations. Look for sideways to
lower price action on Wednesday.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar closed slightly lower on Tuesday due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its gains off last
week's low. Nevertheless, momentum indicators are oversold and
turning neutral to bullish signaling sideways to higher prices into
the end of the year are possible. The March Swiss Franc and D-mark
closed steady to slightly higher due to light short covering on
Tuesday. However, today's poor closes leave the doors open for
sideways to lower prices near-term as both markets appear to have
posted short-term tops with last week's highs. The March Japanese Yen
closed lower on Tuesday after opening under pressure. Concerns over
the Japanese economy and uncertainty over the U.S. Presidential race
triggered today's sell off in the yen. Closes below .9088 would renew
this fall's decline and set the stage for a test of weekly support
crossing at .8978 later this winter.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed mixed on Tuesday. February gold posted a
quiet inside day due to light short covering as it consolidated some
of its recent losses. However, today's mid-range close leaves the
door open for a resumption of the decline off last week's high.
Closes below trendline support crossing near 271.80 would confirm
this fall's rebound has likely come to an end. March silver extended
Monday's short covering rally. However, early gains faded into the
close hinting this week's bounce has likely come to an end. March
silver is poised to renew its decline off last week's high with
November's lows at 4.69 cents being the next target. March copper
closed lower on Tuesday following Monday's spike above the 62%
retracement level of this fall's decline, which crosses at 89.47.
Closes below November's uptrend line crossing near 87.50 would all
but confirm the late-fall rebound has come to an end. Momentum
indicators are overbought and turning neutral to bearish with today's
loss.

GRAINS closed lower on Tuesday. March corn closed fractionally lower
in relatively quiet trading following this morning's neutral supply
and demand report. The USDA lowered its export projection by 75
million bushels to 2.2 billion bushels. The also raised ending stocks
by the same amount to 1.754 billion bushels. These changes were
widely anticipated by the market. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling March corn is likely to drift sideways to lower into the
end of the year. Bulls are hopeful that the Starlink issue will be
resolved by then, which should lead to an increase in foreign demand
after the first of the year. March wheat also closed lower on Tuesday
despite today's surprise increase in this year's export projection by
the USDA. Expectations for lower production in Australia and Europe
led to the increase. Carryout was also cut from 892 to 862 million
bushels. However, spillover weakness from soybeans and meal was
enough of a reason to trigger the late-session sell off. March is
challenging trading range support crossing at 2.69. Closes below this
support level could lead to a test of Sept.'s low at 2.63 1/2 and
possibly long-term support at 2.50 later this winter.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Tuesday. January beans finished the
day on the minus side despite today's increase in U.S. export
projections. The USDA raised export sales for this year from 950 to
975 million bushels and lowered carryout by 30 million bushels to 320
million bushels. January beans are consolidating around fib
resistance crossing at 5.10 3/4. The rising ADX signals sideways to
higher prices near-term are possible. If the post-harvest rally
continues, the fall high at 5.25 is a target. January soybean meal
extended its rebound off last Friday's low following today's friendly
supply and demand report. The USDA raised its export project some
200,000 tons to 7,300 million tons for the year. The increase was due
entirely to the expected increase of meal demand from Europe due to
the recent ban on meat and bone meal in animal feed. While light
profit taking is possible on Wednesday to consolidate some of this
week's gains. The door remains open for sideways to higher prices
into the end of the year. January bean oil closed lower on Tuesday
following today's bearish supply and demand report. The USDA raised
ending stocks from 2.145 to 2.250 billion pounds and lowered export
projections from 1.650 to 1.550 billion pounds. Additional weakness
on Wednesday would set the stage for a test of November's low at
14.64 later this month.

LIVESTOCK closed mixed on Tuesday. February hogs closed lower as
locals faded the funds who are holding sizable long positions.
Additional pressure came from light profit taking following Monday's
spike of the previous contract high. At the same time, cash and pork
cut out values continue to climb due to adverse weather conditions
across the Midwest. Momentum indicators are overbought and diverging,
which is often a precursor to a top and trend change. Closes below
trendline support crossing near 57.40 are needed before this is
confirmed. February cattle posted a key reversal up as it surged to
new highs for the month amid higher boxed-beef prices and
expectations for $76-77 cash bids later this week. Additional support
came from aggressive buying from a believed to be large northwestern
U.S. cattle feeder. February cattle are poised to test long-term
resistance crossing at 77.92 possibly on Wednesday.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Tuesday. March coffee drifted
lower in choppy trading on Tuesday amidst a bearish weather forecast
for this weekend across Brazil. A short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open for a
short covering bounce on Wednesday. March cocoa extended this week's
decline and spiked below November's low at 713 before a short
covering bounce tempered some of today's losses. Today's high-range
close leaves the door open for additional short covering on Wednesday
however, the door is open for a test of psychological support
crossing at 700. March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close
due to a lack of fresh news in the cash market. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling sideways to lower prices into the end of the
year are possible. If the decline resumes, 930 is the next target.
March cotton gapped down and closed sharply lower following today's
bearish supply and demand report. The USDA pegged U.S. production at
17.4 million bales down from last month's estimate of 17.51 million
bales. However, the USDA also raised world ending stocks from 35.10
to 35.69 million bales due to lower demand. Today's gap down and
close below the July/October uptrend line confirms a broad double top
has been posted. The door is open for additional weakness and a
possible test of October's low crossing at 63.75 later this winter.

Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Tuesday's Short Trader Alert Ariba, Inc. (ARBA) lost 7 1/16=20
points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?



Morning Watch List

This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days.=20
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks:=20
http://www.realtimetraders.com/realtimetraders/marketinfo/watchlist.asp



Beyond The Numbers

When will the Election madness come to an end?

The U.S. presidential election was held 6-weeks ago. Since then=20
there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president=20
of United States. Each passing day this matter has gotten more=20
complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with=20
the entire situation. Traders convey the message that the financial =20
markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election, in =20
either direction, will have very little effect on the markets. As one=20
frustrated trader said =01&Mostly markets are looking for an end to this=20
matter, not many care at this point who the next president will be=018.=20
We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed. However,=20
as the cloud clears, markets should be able to find a clear direction=20
from there. As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor=20
George Bush will most likely be the next president.=20

Even negative news is boosting stock prices

Just a few weeks ago, no news was good news for US financial=20
markets. Readers may recall even when there was positive news=20
announcements made by companies, stocks continued to trade=20
lower. However, in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted=20
many better-known names warnings about the upcoming quarterly=20
earnings and about their entire year=01,s outlook. Interestingly enough,=20
following the =01&bad =01&news most of these stocks have rallied to recover=
=20
some of the recent losses. We are still confused about this reaction=20
and trying to make sense of it all. This interesting development brings=20
back some important memories. Some time ago (12-15 months ago)=20
we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left=20
the business or were forced out because they too could not make=20
sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then.=20
Of course, the entire street is aware of what has happened to the=20
Nasdaq in last 8-months.?=20

Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced=20
similar opinions. Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like=20
Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Hedge fund manager Julian=20
H. Robertson, and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult=20
to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news. What's=20
puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher=20
despite the companies loosing money. We believe it is worth pointing=20
out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd.



Sector Analysis

Another big name warns

Tuesday after the close one of the better-known names in the PC world,=20
Compaq Computer (CPQ) warned the company=01,s earnings would fall=20
short of analysts=01, expectations. Following this earnings warning, the=20
box maker's stock briefly dipped down to $19=20
 before bouncing back =20
to finish the session around $20. Given this is the third box maker to=20
pre-announce negative earnings, it may be worth watching the=20
component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the=20
computers. Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc=20
drive makers, memory producers, modem, network card/network=20
suppliers, audio/video and other component makers.=20

Dow Transports may stall around 3000

In the past few sessions we wrote about transportation stocks benefiting=20
from lower crude oil prices. Some of the best performers within the =20
sector were airlines and railroads. As we are approaching the critical=20
resistance level of 3000, we like to alert readers to watch for possible=20
profit taking. Tuesday Transportation index traded as high as 2,970 =20
before settling at 2,905. Tuesday=01,s move up put the index at a 7-month=
=20
high. If the crude oil prices stays around the current levels or move=20
lower, Transportation index may challenge the resistance level and=20
move higher if the markets as a whole moves higher.


Economic Reports & Bond Markets

Retail Report may Set the Stage

Tuesday=01,s long bond moved up 5 ticks to close at 103.13.=20
